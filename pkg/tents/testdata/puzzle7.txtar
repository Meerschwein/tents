I am unsure whether this puzzle is ok or not

Rule on moodle:
Place tents on the grid, so that each tree has a unique horizontally or
vertically adjacent tent. This also means that no tent can "serve" more than one tree.

It seems like one could interpret this to mean that each tree must have exactly one tent
or at least one unique tent.
